# Use case 8 - Rule composition

After a sleepless weekend wondering whether you'll ever be able to clean up the code
created in Use Case 7 you lobby the CTO and get the nod to allocate some time to 
reducing your tech-debt.

## Use Case

As myself
- I want to remove all the duplication in the product service   
- because it is ugly  
- and keeps me awake at night


## You decide that 

- You don't want to define the discount rule more than once
- You don't want to define the price rule type mapping more than once 
- It feels like you might need a combination of
   - Composable rules
   - Accumulative rules 

## Summary

At the end of this scenario you will have

 - Used rule composition to achieve re-use
 - Used a migration pipeline to reduce duplication
